## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

learned to use SASS, which allowed me to comparmentalize my CSS and use functions and variables. There was a bug where using the margin property didn't work unless it defined each one in it's own property, for example, instead of margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px, i had to use margin-top: 1px, margin-right: 2px, etc. I used Prepros for the SASS. Next project i'm just going to use npm and node for it.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on the pros of the Sass framework
