## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I finally figure out positioning images without dealing with a scrollbar. 
Overflow clip margin came to the rescue, so far, positioning was one of my weakest skills but I'm glad I figured it out. 
I wonder why that propertie was difficult to find when googling. For some reason it worked on day and the next it didn't unless I defined it as 0. 
No idea why.
I originally started with a desktop first design, but after feedback on my last challenge and I restarted it in a mobile first mindset. 
I actually enjoy this method more. I'm having less issues scaling up. Not sure when it's best to use CSS resets so I didn't use it here. 
I used grid for the first time in this project and I had many issues with scaling that up, so maybe for those properties it would've been for the best. So I want to practice that more of that in the future. Any feedback would help! I tried to implement all the notes I had for my last challenge! 

### Continued development

I was originally going to use some CSS frameworks like SCSS and others, but I want to fix the things from the lasgt challenges first, also I didn't want to touch
javaScript until neccesary. So, moving forward, I will try other simple frameworks.


### Useful resources

that I needed in the last challenge.
